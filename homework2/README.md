Finish implementing a Prolog program, by defining the predicates corresponding to the following relationships.  
- Spouse
- Daughter  
- Son  
- Sister  
- Brother  
- Grandchild  
- Ancestor  
- Aunt  
- Uncle  
- FirstCousin  
- BrotherInLaw  
- SisterInLaw

These must be general enough to be used in other family trees defined similarly to the file linked above.
